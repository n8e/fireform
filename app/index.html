         <h3>O-Tsukimi, Japan's Harvest Moon Festival</h3>
         <p>You are in a roji ("dewy path", a small Japanese tea garden) on your
           way to your friend's tea house. As you mindfully step on granite stones
           freshly splashed with water for your arrival, you notice that the stone
           lanterns, lit for the evening, are shining a little more brightly than
           usual. You peer inside of one of them, and notice an extra candle.
         </p>
         <p> However, as you round a bamboo fence, the tiny and simple thatched
           roof teahouse comes into view, and you notice that the windows are dark,
           and find this a just a little odd. The tea house roof is so low that you
           have to lower your head as you enter the genkan. Despite your quiet
           arrival, your host welcomes you, opening the small shoji door for you
           to enter the four mat tearoom. In the dim natural light, you see the
           tokonoma, where a scroll painting of a moon, barley visible against the
           palest grey sky, and a bold arrangement of pampas grass and autumn
           flowers are displayed. It’s grown chilly in recent days, so you’re happy
           when your host invites you to sit close to the coals as he prepares the
           kettle for tea.
         </p>
         <p> The light begins to grow brighter to the east, and you look out of the
           open shoji doors to see the moon, barely visible at first, rising past
           the trees in the distance. The sky is cloudless and the air, clear,
           rendering the outline of the moon in crisp detail. As the moon appears,
           impossibly huge and dazzling orange, you take a deep breath and your
           heart fills with joy. As the moon scatters golden reflections on the
           garden pond below, you watch, speechless, as it rises, past the sweeping
           branches of the pines.
         </p>
         <p> It is o-tsukimi, the harvest moon festival, and this is the ideal
           setting in which to celebrate it. While few Japanese are lucky enough
           to have tearooms, let alone a pond with a view to the east, this ancient
           festival is meant to celebrate the beauty of the moon, and the fall
           harvest. At most homes, it’s celebrated in a much more humble manner.
           Autumn flowers and susuki (pampas grass, which is at its tallest and
           most beautiful at this time), are displayed, and kabocha (pumpkin),
           chestnuts, satoimo (taro potato) and tsukimi dango (small white rice
           dumplings, piled high on a tray), are offered to the moon in the family
           alter. The dumplings were traditionally thought to bring happiness and
           good health, and the offering is not only for the moon’s beauty, but an
           expression of gratitude for the autumn harvest.
         </p>
         <p> The festival is said to date back to the Nara period (710-794), when
           it was introduced from China, where it was (and still is) one of it's
           most important festivals, but really took hold during the Heian era
           (794-1185, where it was among a handful of seasonal celebrations of
           the beauty of nature. Court nobles celebrated O-tsukimi by indulging in
           banquets, music and composing poems dedicated to the moon. Today,
           O-tsukimi is also celebrated at temples and shrines, such as the Shimogamo
           shrine in Kyoto, where dances are performed in Heian-era dress to period
           music.
         </p>
         <p> While technically celebrated on jugoya, the 15 night of the solar
           calendar, when the moon is not always full, I plan to celebrate it during
           its greatest moment of beauty, which falls this weekend, on October 3
           and 4. We shall have a picnic on a small lake with a view to the east. I
           shall prepare the food, but I think I shall leave the poetry to my husband
           and singing to my dad.
